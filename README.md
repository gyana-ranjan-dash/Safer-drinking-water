# Safer-drinking-water

Human body contains 60% to 65% of water. We can't even survive without water for few days. But we have a huge source of water. Water covers majority portion of the Earth.

Though ðŸ’§ water is the most abandant resource on the Earth, still only about 2% water can be used for drinking. Now, the 2% also contains suspended solids, sulfates, organic carbon, etc. and if their portions increases more than specified value, this water can't be used for drinking. So the most abandant resource resource on the Earth, which covers 70% of our planet and we can't use it!

The ðŸŽ¯ aim of this exercise is to find out which parameter influences the potability of water and to differntiate potable and non potable water using a ML model.
